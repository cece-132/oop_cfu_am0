# Self Evaluation

__This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?__
  - MAN! I feel so much more confident going into this final because, I get it. Only on an entry level but I really get it and that has been the highlight of my week.

__How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?__
  - So the majority of the week it has been poor. I have been over working myself and honestly, not loving myself. Which definitely did not help my feelings of being inadequate. BUT Today was the first day I woke up feeling really good about myself and my progress. I am just so proud.

__What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?__
  - I have made really good friends in mod 0 and I have a mentor and a really supportive family and partner that really helped me this week. I will definitely be relying on them for help whether its emotional, or a think partner. I just am so happy about how this week went!
